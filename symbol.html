        <h1>The Symbol of Atheryon</h1>
        <p>"Where human clarity meets intelligent acceleration."</p>
        <p>The Atheryon logo features two facing human profiles — one warm, one cool — joined by a neural graph. It symbolizes the connection between human experience and machine intelligence, between judgment and automation, between you and the systems you create.</p>
        <p>The left profile, in golden orange, represents human foresight, creativity, and purpose.</p>
        <p>The right, in sky blue, reflects logic, precision, and adaptive intelligence.</p>
        <p>Between them: a neural network — the connective tissue of agentic systems, decision-making, and governed data flows.</p>
        <p>It is the moment where clarity becomes insight, and insight becomes transformation. It is you and your system, working as one.</p>
        <p>This is Atheryon: A financial intelligence company built on the belief that resilience and speed are no longer opposites — they are engineered together.</p>
